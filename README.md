A class project for a course in programming languages

This is a course project and obvously should not be copied or viewed by anyone from ub who is in my course. If you do copy me, it is at your own risk, and without my consent.
As a student, you are obliged to follow all the universities policies about academic integrity. Don't copy my work.
Or you will be eaten by a pack of ravenous wolverines.
