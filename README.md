A class project for a course in programming languages

This is a course project and obvously should not be copied or viewed by anyone from ub who is in my course. If you do copy me, it is at your own risk, and without my consent.
As a student, you are obliged to follow all the universities policies about academic integrity. Don't copy my work.
Or you will be eaten by a pack of ravenous wolverines.

Seriously, I know a guy who has a bunch of wolverines.
They are fierce, and he is on food stamps so they don't get enough food and are probably hungry. I mean he feeds them, no reason to freak out.
They could just be a little heavier without being, you know, *heavy*. Anyway, don't copy my work.
